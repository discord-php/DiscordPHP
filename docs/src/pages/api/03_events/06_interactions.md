### Interaction Create

Called with an `Interaction` object when an interaction is created.

```php
// use Discord\Parts\Interactions\Interaction;

$discord->on(Event::INTERACTION_CREATE, function (Interaction $interaction, Discord $discord) {
    // ...
});
```

Application Command & Message component listeners are processed before this event is called.
Useful if you want to create a customized callback or have interaction response persists after Bot restart.
