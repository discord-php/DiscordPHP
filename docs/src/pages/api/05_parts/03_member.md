title: "Member"
---

Members represent a user in a guild. There is a member object for every guild-user relationship, meaning that there will be multiple member objects in the Discord client with the same user ID, but they will belong to different guilds.

A member object can also be serialised into a mention string. For example:

```php
$discord->on(Event::MESSAGE_CREATE, function (Message $message) {
    // Hello <@member_id>!
    // Note: `$message->member` will be `null` if the message originated from
    // a private message, or if the member object was not cached.
    $message->channel->sendMessage('Hello '.$message->member.'!');
});
```
