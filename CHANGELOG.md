# Changelog

## Version 5.0.12

- Converted `PromiseInterface` to `ExtendedPromiseInterface` to allow `->done()` typehinting.
- Converted most `->then()` to `->done()` for better error handling.
- Fixed issue with member chunking not working correctly due to changes in Discord's gateway.
- Implemented gateway payload rate-limiting.
- Removed `illuminate/support` dependency.
- Fixed errors in HTTP going into the response handler function and causing errors.
- Added `Channel::limitDelete(n)` to delete the last n messages.
- Added setter functions to embeds. Now much easier to set, and more reliable.
- Added `$guild->leave()` as a shortcut to `$discord->guilds->leave($guild)`.
- Parts are now constructable without factory:

Old:
```php
$message = $discord->factory(Message::class);
```

New:
```php
$message = new Message($message);
```

Both methods are still valid.

- `AbstractRepository` now extends `Collection` rather than having magic functions to handle calls.
- Added `WebhookRepository::get()`.
- Added support functions:
    - `getColor(int $color);`
    - `contains(string $key, array $matches);`
    - `studly(string $string)`
    - `poly_strlen(string $string)`

## Version 5.0.11

- Added dependabot to update composer dependencies.
- Upgraded `react/partial` to `^3.0`.
- `Discord` will now emit `reconnected` when the client reconnects via identify OR resume.
- Fixed issue with resumes not working due to closing with opcode `1000`.
- Client will now attempt to resume after an invalid session if it is still resumable.
- Exceptions inside the `ready` handler will now be caught, emitted via `exception` and logged.
    - Temporary fix until `react/promise ^3.0` is released, as any uncaught exceptions inside promises are dismissed.
- Added `Discord::getChannel(id)` which searches through all guilds and private channels to find a channel.
- `Channel::deleteMessages()` now works for private channels by looping through all messages and deleting.
- Added `Channel::editMessage()`.
- Added new activity types `Activity::TYPE_WATCHING` and `Activity::TYPE_COMPETING`.
- Fixed issue with `MESSAGE_DELETE` events not working correctly.
- Fixed issie with `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE` where members were not removed from their old channels.

## Version 5.0.10

- The PHP composer dependency has been updated to PHP 7.2. The library was not working on anything less in previous versions so I'm not deeming this a breaking change, just a formality.
- Added PHP 7.2 typehinting to functions.
- Added `Collection::first()` to get the first element of the collection.
- Added the ability to call `AbstractRepository::delete()` with a string ID instead of solely a part.
- Any custom logger now may be passed to the Discord client as long as it implementes `LoggerInterface` from PSR.
- Fixed phpdocs for collections, typehinting will now work when accessing it as an array.
- Fixed bug with `Collection::get()` when not searching by discriminator.
- Added `Webhook::execute()`.
- Added support for `illuminate/support` 8.0.
- `Channel::deleteMessages()` will no longer fail if 0 or 1 messages is given. The promise will instantly resolve when given 0, and will delete the one message then resolve for 1 message.
- Fixed error when handling message deletes.
- Websocket will no longer close when an error is seen, as Pawl's errors do not always cause closure of the websocket.
- Fixed bug with rate limiting after changing to `react/http`.
- Fixed bug with sending files after changing to `react/http`.

## Version 5.0.3

- Development of the library will now continue on the `master` branch. The `develop` branch will be removed and you should checkout the latest tag for the most stable version.
- Removed dependency of decepreated package `wyrihaximus/react-guzzle-psr7`, replaced with `react/http`.
    - Rewrote HTTP client to remove dependency of Guzzle.
- Client will prevent updating presence with an invalid activity type.
- Collections:
    - Added `Collection::set($offset, $value)`.
    - Added `Collection::isset($offset)`.
- Added `Message::sendEmbed(Embed $embed)` as a shortcut to sending embeds.
- Fixed an issue on Windows where emoticons were not URL encoded.
- Added `Embed::addField(Field $field)` to add fields to an embed.
- Added user activity statuses constants to `Activity`.
- `Member::addRole(Role $role)` and `Member::removeRole(Role $role)` now modifies the member on Discord's end.
    - You no longer need to run `$guild->members->save($member)`.
    - The function now returns a promise.
- Added `Member::getPermissions(Channel? $channel)` to get the total permissions of the member for a guild or channel.
- The avatar attribute of a user will return their default avatar when it is null.

## Version 5.0.2

- Fixed updating and creating parts.
- Fixed repository saving.
- Removed debugging statement.
- Removed `bind_right` statement that was left over.
- Fixed setting overwrites.

## Version 5.0.1

- Removed option for `bot = false`. This option wouldn't have worked anyway so I am not classing it as a breaking change.
- Converted all getter and setter functions in parts to protected. Again, shouldn't be a breaking change as these function aren't meant to be used outside of the library.
- Webhooks:
    - Added phpdoc to webhook part.
    - Added webhook type constants
- Guilds:
    - Added [new guild attributes.](https://github.com/teamreflex/DiscordPHP/compare/develop#diff-4a22d1c34b22f50e90b71244aac252cdR43-R64)
- Removed unused attributes cache from part.
- Removed `password` attribute from `Client`.
- Added [new user attributes](https://github.com/teamreflex/DiscordPHP/compare/develop#diff-3d3aea0229e2bfd3b386726702468115R29-R36) and flags.
- Voice client now handles websocket closes better.
- Client will now load online users regardless of `loadAllMembers` option. This option will now cause the client to initiate guild member chunking offline members.


## Version 5.0.0
